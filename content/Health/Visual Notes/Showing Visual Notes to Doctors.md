I seemed to be able to communicate much more effectively with my neurologist just by giving him my notes. This gave me an idea.

Complex syndromes like [[The Disease|my disease]] require effective communication with healthcare providers. However, I'm not always able to paint a vivid picture by just talking to the doctor; there seems to be significant information loss. Seeing the efficacy of simple written notes, what if I took this further?

I could create a graphical representation of my symptoms and progression and print it out to show doctors. I could explain things visually, especially my visual symptoms. I can create pages to outline specific episodes or events, one for the overall timeline of symptoms, etc. These may be far easier for the doctor to digest, and the explanations and order is planned out in advance.

I can do this using my skills in HTML and CSS, because I might as well keep them sharp while I'm doing this. Then, I can print off the pages and bring them to appointments.
