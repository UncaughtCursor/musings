Since I've developed breathing problems as part of my [[The Disease|disease]], which primarily happen during sleep, I've realized that I am at much more risk of death during those times. Right now, when my respiration fails, I'm roused from sleep. However, if the mechanism by which running out of air wakes me up is compromised, I may not survive.

If such an event were to happen, I will most likely perceive nothing and have no awareness. From my perspective, I will simply cease to exist in an instant, as if I were software on a computer being unplugged.

This might be the least painful death possible, with no acute physical or psychological pain. Years ago, I theorized that an instant (or perceived to be instant) death with no awareness of it happening would be the most painless cause of death for these reasons. It does, however, come at the cost of closure.

My situation feels like a hybrid of instant death and having awareness of it. While I posess awareness of my potentially deadly scenario, I may not have any awareness of when my death actually happens. So, I can strike a balance: I can [[Publishing Life After Death|leave closure for people now]] and be grateful for existing, while not having to experience the scariest part - the final moments.

If this is indeed what will happen, then although my life will be cut short, this is [[God Is Not Punishing Me|the best death I could have possibly asked for]].

The awareness of my risk now makes sleep feel like a filter.

Imagine a machine with an empty metal doorframe that you are forced to keep stepping through. It's easy to walk right through it, and usually nothing will happen. However, there is a less than 1% chance that when you cross that threshold, it will instantly phase you out of existence, never to return.

Sleep is like that filter. It creates a discontinuity in consciousness, and one day, there may be nothing on the other side. You can delay it, but eventually, you have to step through.
