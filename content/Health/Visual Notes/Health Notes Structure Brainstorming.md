Working outline is [[Health Notes Outline|here]].

## Overview

- An effective overview is paramount, so we should use [[Health Visual Notes Elements#Icon Cards|icon cards]] to emphasize the important points.
- These points are: the 5 symptom types, the association with the spine, and the relapsing-remitting nature (though we should probably use different terminology)
- We want this page to be simple to have high visual impact and make it easy to understand

## Events

- Separate pages for phases and events with a timeline widget at the top with the time period shown
- Visually heterogenous

### The Initial Event

- Cover the initial herniation event
- Diagram of the weakness symptoms and spinal disc that herniated
- Emphasize that MRIs only imaged the region several months later after the initial recovery and the state at the time of injury was unknown
- Show that the disc is still in close proximity to the spinal cord by quoting the MRI readings
## Timeline

- We should probably have this after the main pages describing events as an overview.
