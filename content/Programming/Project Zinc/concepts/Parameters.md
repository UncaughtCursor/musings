Parameters are controllable values on [[Components|components]] that allow for high-level animation control, abstracting away complex animations into simple manageable values.

They may be controlled and coordinated by [[Animations|animations]].

Parameters are defined with:
- Minimum and maximum values.
- A default value.
- Keyframes at a minimum of two different values.
- An interpolation function that connects the keyframes.
