Although I expect my [[The Disease|disease]] to be fatal, there is perhaps a small chance that I will survive, at least for a little while.

Because of this, I should **avoid doing anything that would cause significantly bad side-effects** in case I do survive. Examples would include:

- Spending 100% of my savings
- Telling the public that I am certain of my mortality without a doctor confirming

In general, I should execute my preparations for death without impeding too much on the reality where I still survive for a significant amount of time. This requires a careful balance.
