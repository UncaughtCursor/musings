Since I've developed breathing problems as part of my [[The Disease|disease]], which primarily happen during sleep, I've realized that I am at much more risk of death when I go to sleep. Right now, when my respiration fails, I'm roused from sleep. However, if the mechanism by which running out of air wakes me up is compromised, I may not survive.

If such an event were to happen, I will most likely perceive nothing and have no awareness. From my perspective, I will simply cease to exist in an instant, as if I were a robot being unplugged.

This might be the least painful death possible, with no acute physical or psychological pain. Years ago, I theorized that an instant (or perceived to be instant) death with no awareness of it happening would be the least bad cause of death for these reasons. It does, however, come at the cost of closure.

My situation feels like a hybrid of instant death and having awareness of it. While I posess awareness of my potentially deadly scenario, I may not have any awareness of when my death actually happens. So, I can strike a balance: I can [[Publishing Life After Death|leave closure for people now]] and be grateful for existing, while not having to experience the scariest part - the final moments.

If this is indeed what will happen, then although my life will be cut short, this is [[God Isn't Punishing Me|the best death I could have possibly asked for]].
