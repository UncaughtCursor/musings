A big factor in my resilience, allowing me to [[Facing Unspeakable Horrors|face the horrors of my disease]], is a principle that I call optimistic pessimism:

**Prepare for the worst, and ground your happiness and gratitude in things that cannot be taken away, regardless of the outcome.**

Expecting things out of life that are not necessarily always achievable (e.g. success, the perfect relationship, a healthy life) sets one up for a major fall. If these things cannot be manifested, it will be devastating for the individual. Suddenly, the life they had envisioned is rendered impossible, and they are thrown onto an undesired new path.

We are all human. We know that life is messy, and lots of humans end up in terrible situations through no fault of their own. Do not think it can't be you. That was my mistake. It's never too late for the stars to suddenly misalign and crash into Earth. It's not your fault; it just happens that way sometimes.

There is a lot to be grateful for now. The ability to [[We Are The Richest Organisms|experience all of the things we do]], comprehend the incredible [[Life is Awesomely Complex|incredible complexity]] of it all, and experience emotions are all things I am so grateful for. Life is such a [[Life is a Beautiful Light Show|rich and vivid experience]] for me that I'm okay with everything going horribly wrong if it can't be avoided. Everyone dies, and the overwhelming majority of people have gone through times of pain and suffering. It's simply outside of our control.

It's true that life can be taken away from us in a literal sense. But in a mental sense, life cannot be taken away from us because we never experience a moment without it. Optimistic pessimism uses the latter interpretation. As long as you are alive and able to process information, it will always be possible to use optimistic pessimism.

Social comparison is a powerful foe here. But remember that the people at the top of society are extraordinarily lucky. They tell you that if you work hard like them, you'll be successful like them too. And while the drive to be successful certainly increases your odds, there will never not be a component of luck. You can be the smartest and most competent person in the world, but if you accidentally fall and hit your head too hard, all of that could be wiped out in an instant. It's just not fair for a lot of people; circumstances outside of one's control can put anyone on a bad path. Disease, accidents, economic changes, or just bad luck can have huge effects and affect anyone.

It's good to shoot for the moon, but don't be too hard on yourself if life doesn't work out that way.
