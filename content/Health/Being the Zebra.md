I heard that an oft-repeated phrase in medicine is:

> When you hear the sound of hooves, think horses, not zebras.

Effectively, this means that doctors should expect more common medical conditions before considering rare ones.

Fine in theory. This would work for most people.

But what becomes of the zebras?

Doctors probably don't see rare conditions very often, hence the label. I would expect that their intuition for diagnosing common conditions is stronger than for rare ones since the former gets used way more often. This is great... if you're a horse.

I suspect that this is the primary reason why the medical system has thus far failed to diagnose my [[The Disease|disease]]. Doctors try to explain my symptoms using those common diagnoses, but there's always missing context, unexplained symptoms, and something that doesn't quite add up.

## Small-Fiber Neuropathy

After the November 2021 [[Flare-Ups|flare-up]], I had constant pain covering my entire body. Desperate for answers, I eventually got seen by a neurologist. He diagnosed me with small-fiber neuropathy, a condition where damage to the small-fiber peripheral nerves were damaged. This did not appear to explain why there was pain in my face and on my eyes, nor the progression of the condition.

One day, there was a dull pain in the back of my eyes and my vision suddenly blurred, and nothing I did made it go away. Periodically, the blur would fade in and out, until it stopped. Later that day, I noticed that my vision had gotten darker. It never recovered. This appeared to very closely match the description for optic neuritis. This was very interesting, because it strongly pointed to an autoimmune nervous system disease like multiple sclerosis, something I had already theorized before.

I tried to be subtle when talking to doctors, floating bits and pieces of my theory to them to see if they would consider it. I never told them the full theory, because I knew they would dismiss it as self-diagnosis and probably be biased *against* investigating it. This consideration did not happen. The neurologist said the symptom "didn't match up" with the diagnosis. Instead of considering that he was incorrect, he instead assumed it was something unrelated, despite happening during a flare-up. It's really odd for someone so young to just suddenly lose their vision like that, but what do I know?

In response to the discrepancies I noted between the diagnosis and my actual symptoms and progression, the neurologist told me to just wait for a nerve biopsy test to confirm his diagnosis. This took several months. The end result was negative. All of that time, wasted.

In fact, the neurologist was so confident that he claimed that his diagnosis was "the only possible neurologic explanation." This singular quote felt like the epitome of my entire experience, because of just how badly it would age in spite of its confidence.

## Progression

The current phase of my disease involved the sudden progression of cognitive symptoms, hallucinations and sudden large muscle jerks at night, and, most critically, breathing dysfunction at night, with breathing continually slowing to a stop before restarting. Had I believed the neurologist, I would have been extremely shocked. But somehow, I managed to predict the otherwise extremely unlikely onset of brain damage at age 21.

This is what being a zebra gets you. Even if you know exactly what you have, you're forced to watch as doctors fumble with horse diagnoses as your condition deteriorates more and more. I'm sure I will thoroughly enjoy my prize of cynicism, preventable damage, and a potentially life-threatening symptom.
