## Icon Cards

![[Health Notes Icon Cards.png]]Icons with headings and supplemental text communicate big ideas in visually distinct ways.

The amount of space around them makes them stand out visually compared to a simple bulleted list.

## Symptom Type Icons

Symptom type icons are both an aesthetic choice and a way of organizing symptoms. This color coding makes symptoms more distinct from each other in appearance.

| Type | Color | Icon |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Sensory | Green | Hand |
| Motor | Red | Bicep |
| Autonomic | Orange | Gear |
| Visual | Purple | Eye |
| Cognitive | Blue | Brain |

These are simple diagrams of a human male body that can be shaded in with different colors. (Probably a clip-path?). Can optionally contain a legend with solid colors or a sliding shade scale indicating intensity.
