Perhaps we could attempt to quantify whether or not to make [[The Lifestyle Dilemma|life choices]] and pursue experiences using fuzzy, imprecise numbers.

Perhaps this inequality could represent whether one should pursue an experience $E$:

$$
C_\text{no E}P_\text{no E} > C_E
$$
Where:
$C_\text{no E}$ is the cost of losing the ability to experience $E$.
$P_\text{no E}$ is the probability of losing the ability to experience $E$ over the relevant timeframe.
$C_E$ is the cost of experiencing $E$.

Cost in this case refers to emotional pain. In the case of $C_\text{no E}$, this is the sadness and disappointment associated with knowing one can no longer experience $E$. By contrast, in the case of $C_E$, this is the unease or disappointment of expending the time, money, and resources needed to experience $E$.

Let's say I want to visit and walk around the Grand Canyon. But, my disease could render me paralyzed and prevent me from doing that ever again. For this example, let's say I estimate a 10% probability over the next 6 months that my legs become too weak to walk, and that the pain of going to visit the Grand Canyon - the inconvenient road trip, the cost, the time - would be 1/20th the pain of losing the ability to experience it. So, we can use 1 for $C_E$, 20 for $C_\text{no E}$, and 0.2 for $P_\text{no E}$.

Our formula becomes:

$$
(20)(0.1) > 1
$$
$$
2 > 1
$$

Since the left side is greater than the right, I should plan a trip to the Grand Canyon in the next 6 months to be less disappointed on average. That's what this represents - the number on the left represents the average pain for not experiencing the event, while the number on the right represents the average pain for investing the time, money, and resources to experience the event.

An interesting property of this is that over the course of the lifetime, $P_\text{no E}$ is 100%, since you lose the ability to experience everything by the end. At that point, the only thing that matters is whether $C_\text{not E}$ is greater than $C_E$, and if so, you should try to experience it.



In practice, you can never win; there will always be some disappointment. Especially in my case, facing a diminished life expectancy, the safest option is to not expect so much out of life and be satisfied with almost any outcome, grateful for the wonderful things that you *do* experience.

Nothing is a guarantee except right now. Advertising and social expectations are good at leaving us dissatisfied and wanting more out of life, whether it's the desire to visit Disney World every year, play every video game that looks fun, have a successful career, or live to 80 years old. And while it's fine to pursue those things, it's easy to forget that life is still unpredictable and those things could easily become impossible due to factors outside of your control, through no fault of your own. None of us will be able to experience everything, but perhaps that makes things we *do* experience all the more special.

The probability you'll be around for the next few days is generally very high though, so you can probably afford a few wishes here and there. I myself would be quite sad if I never took the time to [[Publishing Life After Death|write down these notes for my family]] to read after I pass away, and ultimately, I think that's more than worth slowing down my career for.
