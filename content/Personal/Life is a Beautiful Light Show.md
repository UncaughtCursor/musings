Life is like the most beautiful light show in the universe. Most of the universe changes over millions and billions of years, but our world changes in mere months. We are among the most dynamic and interesting things in the universe, and our lives are so incomprehensibly detailed and varied. We do so much in so little time, and our experiences are so novel, that it's like a beautiful and elaborate light show, the most vibrant and dynamic events the universe has to offer.

It can be easy to forget how absolutely insane it is just how much unique stuff there is and how much everything changes all the time. Not to mention the fact that humans somehow found a way to create their own virtual universes where you can interact with pure constructs of imagination. The stories humans told each other by the fire suddenly turned into unique experiences you could actually have in just a couple hundred years using technology nobody back then could scarcely imagine. Life is more fun and entertaining now than it has ever been in human history.

It's all a mesmerizing light show, the most strange and awe-inspiring thing we've ever seen. But even the most impressive light shows in the universe have to end eventually. But, I'm not too torn up about it, because it was so incredible. Every second was worth it.
