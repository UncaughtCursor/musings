We expect [[The Disease|our disease]] to progressively diminish the function of our central nervous system.

We may rectify this using a pulse system.

Information can be effectively communicated through pulses of unique patterns.

The extent to which we need this is [[Is It Necessary|debatable]].

To ensure that information is able to be written using digital switches (no amplitude variation), we rely on distinct signals to convey back-and-forth information.

The information transmission rate depends on the following:

- The number of distinct signal types (signals)
- The number of pulses happening at once (channels)
- The length of the pulses

This is limited practically by the precision with which we are able to read and write information.

Information can be sent over [[Mediums|multiple different mediums]] to accommodate different levels of disability.

For ease of transition between mediums upon disability progression, it is best to use a common language between all mediums.

The total data transmission rate can be derived from the formula,
$$
R=\frac{C\log_2(S)}{D}
$$
Where:
$R$ is the transmission rate in bits per second,
$C$ is the number of concurrent channels,
$S$ is the number of distinct signals,
$D$ is the average pulse length in seconds.

For example, with 4 channels, 8 signal types, and a pulse length of 0.25 seconds, the total transmission rate is:
$$
R=\frac{4\times\log_2(8)}{0.25}
$$
$$
R = 48 \text{ bit/s}
$$
Assuming 6 bits per standard character and 5 characters per word, this is fast enough to read at 96 words per minute.

This system has the added advantage of being able to speed up and slow down the pulse length in case it is too fast or slow to process, while keeping the same underlying language.

It's probably best for us to use one character, phoneme, or other unit of information per pulse to create a strong association with existing language structures. In practice, this may decrease the transmission rate in exchange for faster adoption. We go into more depth with the language used [[language|here]].
