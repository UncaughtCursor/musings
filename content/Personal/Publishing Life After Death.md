One reason I started [[Collecting Thoughts]] here was to capture them and paint a picture of who I was as a person.

When I wrote my own public [[The Farewell Message|farewell message]], I thought about how much of my life would never be known, that it would all die with me.

I would prefer if people, especially my family, had the option of learning who I really was. Even if that means exposing fundamental differences in beliefs, I would rather for them to have a genuine picture of me and who I truly was inside.

A giant collection of my thoughts would be as close as possible to such a picture.

I tend to be very guarded around people, including my family, and [[Hiding My True Self|don't expose a lot about myself]]. I try to avoid exposing vulnerable or controversial parts of myself as a defense mechanism, and this strategy has served me well. Until now.

Once I die, everything about me that isn't captured or recorded somewhere will be gone. If I don't write these things down, then the essence of who I was as a person will be lost. Instead, people would only remember my outer shell, the facade that I put on because I was too afraid to be fully genuine. Nobody would ever know the true me.

My experience with life is very rich, and I am full of emotions and experiences that I never shared with anyone. But I want people to know. I want people to know the things I loved, the things that made me happy, and my gratitude for being able to experience life at all. There are no consequences for being vulnerable after death, so I'm happy to share all of it, even my imperfections.
