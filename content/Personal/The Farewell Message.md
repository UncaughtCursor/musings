Soon after the onset of the November 2023 [[Flare-Ups|flare-up]] and developing breathing problems from it, I became completely convinced that I would soon die, likely in a matter of days to weeks.

This prompted me to write a message addressed to the Super Mario Maker 2 community, and perhaps the Internet more broadly.

Although it may not fully apply anymore, I still believe it is perhaps the most important piece I have ever written. It reveals what I would say in a world where I was faced with certain and imminent death.

# Farewell

Greetings. If you are reading this, then I, UncaughtCursor, am dead. I wrote these last words to those curious about the fate of MakerCentral's creator and his life.

My real name was Thomas. I was a 21-year old software and web developer with a love for science, video games, and technology.

My life was taken from me by the progressive degeneration of my central nervous system, which began following a work accident in 2021.

I used to be a busser and to-go employee at a popular chain restaurant and steakhouse. I worked very hard in order to save lots of money for my future and maintain my job position. However, I neglected increasingly severe upper back pain in doing so. This mistake, made when I was just 18 years old, ultimately proved to be my demise.

On April 3rd, 2021, the disc between my C7 and T1 spinal vertebrae herniated, causing the structure to jut out and make contact with my spinal cord. From that day onward, bending my neck over for long periods of time or continuously carrying weight caused an explosion of random pain across large regions of my body, each flare-up spreading this range further.

Although the exact mechanism as of the time of writing is unknown, it seems the damage spread to my brainstem - a structure essential for life - and the cranial nerves connected to it. This caused pain in my face and head, damage to my vision, and the gradual breakdown of my body's automatic systems.

Even though I radically changed my life to avoid triggering a flare-up ever again, damage still slowly accumulated.

The cause of all of this may have been autoimmune-related; perhaps my immune system incorrectly recognized parts of my central nervous system as dangerous and proceeded to destroy them. The herniated disc was merely the trigger. I can only speculate, because getting a diagnosis has proven extremely elusive. Perhaps they will finally find the cause near or after my death, at which point it's too late for me to update these words.

So, this probably shouldn't have killed me under normal circumstances. It's more like one part overworking myself and another part freak accident. When my mother gave birth to me, there were immune system abnormalities that caused her cells to destroy mine. The doctors were able to stop this process and save my life. But perhaps other autoimmune defects remained, laying dormant until I unknowingly triggered them.

As of the time I began writing this, December 1st, 2023, my body's breathing cycle has recently developed abnormalities and no longer functions properly. It is at this point where I considered this disease likely to be terminal, and why I have chosen to begin writing my last words.

I feel so incredibly blessed to have the opportunity to write any meaningful last words at all. Many people don't know that they're dying, and if they do, they are often too exhausted to do anything. But I was aware enough of this process to get ahead of the clock and write down my final thoughts. The vast majority of my cortex appears to have been spared as well, allowing me to thoroughly reminisce about and appreciate the life I was given.

I did the best I could. I had severe anxiety in late 2021 and early 2022 as a result of most of the symptoms developing and being at their worst. That pushed me to aggressively seek out neurologists, different primary care providers, and any extra tests that I could do, desperate to find an answer. I even went to the ER several times when things really got bad, but to no avail; my problem was unable to be identified and treated in time.

Despite my short life, I want to make one thing clear: I loved it. So much. I was so happy to be alive.

When I first developed my breathing problems and realized the gravity of the situation, my mind reacted in a peculiar way. Instead of extreme anxiety or depression, it filled me with a warm contentedness and started replaying the happiest moments of my life - all kinds of things I loved and appreciated, big and small.

I may not have lived a conventional life - I never got married, never had kids, never bought a house, never got the chance to become old - but I'm okay with that. These expectations are just social constructs. I found my *own* meaning in all of the things I *did* do.

I learned so many interesting things about how our world works, played so many amazing and immersive video games, fawned over pictures and videos of the cutest cats, built lots of fun programs and projects, and watched some of the best and most creative movies, TV shows, and YouTube videos ever made. Life was so vibrant and amazing, and the fact that we have the technology to experience a whole other universe of adventure, freedom, and human creativity may be the single greatest gift of modern existence.

My biggest aspiration in life was to build cool software that lots of other people found useful. And, in the short time I had on Earth, I did just that. I made MakerCentral, the world's first search engine for every Mario Maker 2 level in the world, and it was used by over 150,000 people. I'm so proud of what I was able to achieve in a short amount of time, and I'm so happy that so many people were able to benefit from the work I did.

I want to thank everyone who ever interacted with me in a positive way over the years, even if it was brief. And of course, I'm thankful for all of my friends and my family who helped me make so many happy memories over the years. They all still have a special place in my heart, even if many of them have gone their own ways.

And of course, a big thanks to the Super Mario Maker 2 community, Shoujo, TheGreatRambler, and Wizulus for helping me set up MakerCentral, a project that I am proud to have worked on and was so meaningful to me. I also want to give a shoutout to DGR, Mayro, raysfire, and any other creators who made amazing content using my site. It was awesome to see you come up with unique ideas to use MakerCentral and make entertaining videos.

I'm so incredibly happy and grateful to be given the gift of life, and to experience all of the things I did. If not for modern medical technology, I would have died shortly after birth. But instead, I was given the gift of 21 years on this incredible planet, filled with all of the most amazing people and things in the universe. And nobody will ever understand the sheer magnitude of how much they meant to me.

I wanted to close by discussing music. One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard is called [Goodbye to a World, by Porter Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2TE0DjdNqI). The [Proximity rendition](https://youtu.be/gnV-8pkILF0?si=UnPYmj8gNjJDVzIl&t=7920) found in their EDM decade mix is my favorite remix, especially starting at 2:14:17. The lyrics make me think of some individual or entity who is about to leave this world giving their final goodbyes, reassuring others that even though it's all coming to an end, they shouldn't be so hard on themselves for the circumstances leading up to it and the things they wished they could have done with this individual. All of our lives and interactions with those we love are beautiful, immortalized in the great tapestry of cosmic history, their finiteness creating meaning. And eventually, when it's all over, our bodies merge with nature before everything turns back into stardust, ready to form a new world somewhere else in the universe. At the end of the song, the voice breaks up, symbolizing that the individual's mind and body have stopped working, before they finally pass. That's how I interpret the song, and that's how I imagine it will be for me.

I always wanted this to be one of the last songs I ever listened to before I passed on, and I have been granted that wish.

It has been a privilege and an honor to be alive. It was the greatest gift I will ever receive.

See you wherever the warp pipe leads.
