It now seems likely that I will survive the November 2023 [[Flare-Ups|flare-up]]. This is for a few reasons:

- Breathing function seems to have stopped declining.
- Blood oxygen levels overnight is in the low to mid 90s most of the time, only sometimes dropping to the high 80s. There are currently about 5.5 3% oxygen desaturation events per hour, which indicates mild sleep apnea. This is nowhere near life-threatening levels.
- Symptom progression appears to be slowing down or stopping.
- The last flare-up lasted for about 2 months, and it has now been 2 months.

Hopefully, this means a remission soon. And hopefully, another one that's longer than a year.
