Symptom type icons are both an aesthetic choice and a way of organizing the visual notes. This color coding makes symptoms more distinct from each other in appearance.

| Type | Color | Icon |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Sensory | Green | Hand |
| Motor | Red | Bicep |
| Autonomic | Orange | Gear |
| Visual | Purple | Eye |
