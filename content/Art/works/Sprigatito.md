This is the first good art I've made! People I shared it with seemed to like it a lot.

I love cats, Pokémon, and [[Loving Cuteness|cuteness]], so it's no wonder why I adore Sprigatito. It's my favorite Pokémon.

I fell in love with his 3D model in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet because he always had such a dopey cross-eyed expression, so I tried to incorporate that into my design a little bit.

Since I made it out of a bunch of smaller parts, I might create [[Project Zinc|Zinc]] to animate it.
Having him move his head down, causing his whiskers and ears to shake, while he closes its eyes and opens his mouth in a smile would be an adorable animation.

I was able to do so well because I tried some [[Pixel Art Methods|new strategies]]. They really paid off!

I'm really happy that I drew Sprigatito; I feel like I was able to capture and exaggerate the details I personally adore, and the result is that I love what I have created. I feel a personal connection with this and it feels like a souvenir, an emblem of a cherished part of my life.
