I highly value recording my own thoughts.

In the past, I often looked at logs of past messages I've sent to others, talking about random things, but this is a much more organized way to do it.

Getting a glimpse of my past and present self gives me a deeper understanding of who I am and how I changed.

And now, this serves a new purpose: allowing others to understand who I am too.

There is a whole lot to think about.
