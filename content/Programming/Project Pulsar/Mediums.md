Information from pulses can be consumed in several different ways:

| Medium    | Amplitude  | Signal   | Channels                                | Application                     |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Light     | Brightness | Color    | Blocks of color next to each other      | Partial blindness               |
| Sound     | Volume     | Pitch    | Waveforms (square, triangle, sine, etc) | Complete blindness              |
| Vibration | Strength   | Patterns | Multiple vibrating devices              | Complete blindness and deafness |

Given that the overwhelming majority of multiple sclerosis patients do not fully lose all of these senses including touch, this should cover the vast majority of sensory loss cases.

## Signals by Medium

The [[Language|Pulsar language]] uses 8 main signal types. These are expressed differently in different mediums.

| Medium    | Signal 0 | Signal 1 | Signal 2 | Signal 3 | Signal 4 | Signal 5 | Signal 6 | Signal 7 |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Light     | Black    | Red      | Orange   | Yellow   | Green    | Blue     | Violet   | White    |
| Sound     | C4       | D4       | E4       | F4       | G4       | A4       | B4       | C5       |
| Vibration | ...      | ..-      | .-.      | .--      | -..      | -.-      | --.      | ---      |

For light, the colors described are those displayed.

For sound, these are sound waves playing at the frequency of the music note described.

For vibration, dots are low frequency vibrations, while dashes are high frequency. Each of these "sub-pulses" takes up 1/3rd of a full pulse.
