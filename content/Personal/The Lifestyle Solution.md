The solution to [[The Lifestyle Dilemma]] is most likely a compromise between what I *want* to do and what I *have* to do.

As of 2/5/24, my current estimate for my life expectancy is **1-5 years left with medium confidence**, meaning that I think I will [[Surviving the November 2023 Flare-Up|probably]] live for 1-5 more years, with a small chance that I could die sooner. In that case, I would want to do at least one more big project before focusing on my legacy.

It also turns out that I just really want to program things. Working on projects that interest me was always a big part of my life, and I want it back.

However, this will need to be balanced with the creation of my [[Showing Visual Notes to Doctors|health notes]] and the initiative to seek the cause of the disease (going to research hospitals, contacting researchers, etc.)

I'll also want to do some writing and art, in case I do still kick the bucket early.
