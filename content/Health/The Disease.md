The Disease is a malignant process that has been slowly deteriorating my neurological function since April 2021.

It is disabling and potentially fatal.

Because of this, it is critical for me to be ready for anything.

## Onset

During my time working at Texas Roadhouse, physical labor and long working hours led to me developing upper back pain. Eventually, while writing names on bags, my arms suddenly dropped with weakness and numbness. An MRI scan much later would show a C7-T1 herniated disc. Weakness and numbness in the arms recovered after a week, and symptoms began in the hands soon after.

## Symptoms and Progression

### Physical

**Active:**

- Random neuropathic pain and fasciculations nearly everywhere in the body, which includes the face and head
- [[Optical Anomalies|Visual disturbances]]
- Permanent vision loss in right eye
- Double vision in right eye
- Shadows/blind spots that only appear when moving eyes and head a certain way
- Random moments of vertigo
- Tingling on the entire left side of the face
- Auditory hallucinations when trying to sleep
- Large-scale involuntary movements when trying to sleep, to the point of both arms shooting off the bed, suddenly sitting up, or all four limbs violently jerking completely involuntarily
- Automatic breathing continually slows down and stops when trying to sleep
- Difficulty emptying bladder (takes several seconds to minutes)
- Frequent urination
- Slow/weak urination
- Worse balance
- Sometimes passing gas involuntarily (sphincter weakness?)
- No urge to have a bowel movement

**Dormant:**

- Tremor in chest
- Legs feeling heavy
- Episode of whole body weakness for 2 days, bad enough to need a wheelchair

### Cognitive

**Active:**

- Difficulty remembering things, short and long term
- Misreading words, forming incorrect sentence structures, forgetting words, writing incorrect words
 * Reading errors usually consist of words that have similar letters
   Examples:
   Prototypical -> Philosophical
   Word -> More
 * Writing errors usually consist of words that are part of the same category or have similar letters
   Examples:
   Pie -> Ice cream
   Channel -> Chill
- Internal monologue randomly becoming senseless babbling

**Dormant:**

- None


Progression of the disease mostly happens in distinct flare-ups, followed by remissions, the history of which is documented [[Flare-Ups|here]]. Historically, they have been directly caused by pressure on the disc, but recently, flare-ups appear to be happening independently of this. Some symptoms, such as vertigo and mild cognitive symptoms, developed outside of a marked flare-up event.

## Classification

I believe that the disease is ultimately an atypical form of multiple sclerosis, triggered by and exacerbated by my herniated disc's contact with the spinal cord, triggering a runaway autoimmune response that could be classified as multiple sclerosis.

Periods of recovery and unnoticeable activity suggest a relapsing-remitting pattern characteristic of RRMS.

Multiple sclerosis commonly involves optic neuritis, bladder issues, balance issues, cognitive symptoms, and other CNS-related dysfunctions. I have all of these.

A spine specialist noted that the herniated disc, while being in close proximity to the spinal cord, should not impede function. This lends credibility to the autoimmunity hypothesis, wherein the immune system is responsible for the damage, not the disc itself.

### Congenital Dormant Autoimmunity Theory

Still, a herniated disc leading to an autoimmune attack on the central nervous system seems to be an undocumented phenomenon; I have seen not one medical paper describing such an interaction. If this is not multiple sclerosis, it may be an extremely rare disease, and I may be the only person in the world who has it due to unusual environmental factors. Some argue that [multiple sclerosis is a spectrum of demyelinating diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_demyelinating_diseases_of_the_central_nervous_system) with numerous specific causes, including multiple classes of autoantibodies and different environmental factors.

I nearly died shortly after birth. Although I don't fully remember the details, my mother's immune system was destroying my own cells, and I required multiple blood transfusions.

This may have caused my immune system to learn to target a specific protein in an aggressive manner that happens to appear in my neurons or the surrounding myelin insulation. It may be that response to a spinal cord injury (such as minor compression) causes a flood of immune cells to target my spinal cord and eventually brain, detecting the presence of this protein.

Essentially, this would mean that this condition had been lying dormant for 18 years before finally striking once there was an injury on or very close to my spinal cord.

I am not a biologist though, so I don't know for sure. Other potential causes include other environmental factors, virsues, or my scoliosis surgery.

## Prognosis

Due to what appears to be extensive involvement with the brainstem and cervical spine, disruption of critical mechanisms like breathing, and the ample amount of time for progression, I believe that the disease is likely to be fatal. There are [[Causes of Death|multiple ways this could happen.]]

A minority of cases of multiple sclerosis are severe enough to [cause death relatively shortly after onset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_multiple_sclerosis), so this is not unprecedented; it is entirely possible for aggressive and severe demyelinating disease to be fatal.

Additionally, a [medical paper about neurological respiratory failure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224095/) states:

>Inflammatory and infectious diseases of the CNS are a very heterogeneous group of diseases that can affect CNS function with different patterns of symptoms and signs. Pulmonary complications are related to an **altered breathing control system**, severity of associated reduction of consciousness, and involvement of respiratory muscles. Pulmonary impairments have long been recognized as major causes of morbidity and **mortality** in individuals with advanced **multiple sclerosis**, due to acute or chronic respiratory disorders. Chronic RF (Respiratory Failure) involves bulbar (brainstem) dysfunction with swallowing disorders, **altered central respiratory drive**, motor disorders following corticospinal lesions, or **sleep-disordered breathing**. Acute conditions mainly involve spinal or bulbar (brainstem) relapse with extensive plaques, neurogenic pulmonary edema, or ARF (Acute Respiratory Failure), often following sepsis. Common pulmonary-related complications in encephalitis are poor gag reflex, pooling of secretion, and loss of swallowing, with risk of aspiration pneumonia and RF (Respiratory Failure) development.

In plain English, this means that, for inflammatory central nervous system diseases like multiple sclerosis, life-threatening outcomes can occur due to disordered central respiratory control, including sleep-disordered breathing, which encompasses the breathing symptoms I experience. This heavily implies that an exacerbation of my current symptoms or a flare-up that attacks more of this area can be fatal.

In other words, **I may be only one event away from death.**

I have been processing this outcome [[Some Thoughts on Death|in many different ways]].

My disease seems to be [[Facing Unspeakable Horrors|hard for others to process]] when they hear about it.

As with regular MS, the disease may also become severely disabling, with the possibility of sudden paralysis and blindness. This has led me to consider the creation of [[Project Pulsar]].
