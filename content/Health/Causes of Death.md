There are three main ways I predict for [[the disease]] to be fatal:

## Autonomic

This refers to a catastrophic failure of the brain's automatic control of processes in the body. It appears to be the most likely option due to what appears to be heavy involvement of the brainstem and/or cranial nerves. Causes from this category include:

- Sudden cardiac arrest due to heart arrhythmia
- Respiratory failure due to failure to regulate breathing
- Dangerous blood pressure levels due to failure to regulate it
- Aspiration pneumonia due to dysphagia
- Sepsis from a UTI due to urinary retention
- Falls or accidents due to balance issues or low blood pressure

## Motor

This refers to the loss of the brain's ability to control the muscles. Causes from this category include:

- Respiratory failure due to paralysis of the lungs
- Falls or accidents due to partial weakness or paralysis

## Mental

This refers to the dysfunction of cognitive processes, emotional regulation, and perception of reality due to brain damage. Causes from this category include:

- Risky behavior or violence due to delusions, disinhibition, or drastic personality damage
- Suicide due to unbearable suffering or the above

## Other Causes

These are niche causes that may also happen, but are probably quite unlikely:

- Falls or accidents due to diminished senses (e.g. vision and hearing)
