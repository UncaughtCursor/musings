Yes.

But I don't mind.

Invariably, by [[Publishing Life After Death|publishing my thoughts about everything]], I will expose fundamental differences in beliefs and outlook. Perhaps the most prominent of them being my political beliefs and lack of religious beliefs. My family might even attribute my fate to God punishing me for these differences, which is an idea that [[God Is Not Punishing Me|I couldn't disagree more on.]]

I found my existence to be much happier when I didn't force myself to believe what my family did and made sense of the world in my own way. Some may see secularism as a breeding ground for unsettling existential questions that are answered by religion, I myself find great gratitude and intrigue in realizing how [[Life is Awesomely Complex|complex and incredible]] the world and our lives are and just how much there is to see, learn, and experience.

Currently, I don't know the extent to which my family knows how much I differ from them. To avoid social rejection, I have [[Hiding My True Self|kept quiet on these matters]]. For someone who may become dependent on others to survive, social rejection is an existential threat.

But that is the only thing I care about. I don't feel shame for who I am because I'm just another person living their life. I try to do what I believe is right and have my own way of thinking, and that's completely okay.

I also don't suffer too much as a result of these differences. I'm okay with being the odd one out, as long as I'm allowed to experience the world and its joys in my own way.
