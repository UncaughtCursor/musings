On the Internet, I'm known as UncaughtCursor.

If you were ever curious as to why, it's because it's meant to represent a cat trying to catch a mouse cursor.

Cats are really cute when they chase moving objects, which they like to do a lot. I used to volunteer at an animal shelter with cats, and one of my favorite things to do was to pull out a wand toy and try to evade the cats' attempts to catch the object dangling from it.

Since software development and general computer use is a big part of my life, I thought it would be fun to apply this to a mouse cursor, where a cat tries to reach for and grab a mouse cursor as if it were a fast-moving laser pointer.

The cat featured in my avatar is a [[Ragdoll Cats|Ragdoll cat]], a really fluffy and friendly cat breed that I adore, and one that I personally had an encounter with in the past.
