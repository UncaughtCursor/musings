Our recent success in art has been thanks to the following:

**Measurement:** By precisely measuring proportions, positions, and angles on our references, our shape accuracy has gotten astronomically better.

**Pixel Art Aesthetic:** This art style is simple and allows for easy trial and error, as well as hiding mistakes and making simpler details, shading, and colors acceptable.

**Dithering:** Dithering allows for partial shading in a restricted color palette. By making sparing use of this technique, our art has been made a bit better.

**Bezier Curves:** By using Bezier curves instead of freehanding, we're able to draw curves much more precisely.

**Modern Image Software:** Image software just make art easier than pencil in paper. Things like zooming in, managing layers, etc make a huge difference.
