Project Zinc's UI is a simple interface that makes it easy to define [[Components]] and [[Animations]].

The creation of Zinc's UI would be useful in the creation of [[The Maple Editor]] for all of the symmetry and shared functionality (e.g. defining paths in space, Bezier interpolation curves, general layout, etc)
