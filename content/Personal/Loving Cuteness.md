I love cute, adorable creatures. They bring me so much joy to look at their innocent little faces. I want to hug them, to protect them, to enjoy their presence.

Perhaps it's a natural response, but I seem to respond more to cute things than most other guys I know. But maybe they're too shy to admit to it. At least some of them are.

I'm so grateful that my mind reacts in this way, making me feel happy for just perceiving the purest, most innocent creatures after they cross my visual field.

It was my biggest insecurity too, and I beat myself up over just liking cats and wanting to show affection to them. It's because I felt that these feelings were [[Gender Stereotypes|in stark opposition to male gender norms]], and they were therefore a defective aspect of my personality.

But getting over that just makes me even more grateful that I can enjoy these things now, knowing that I might not have gotten over those feelings in an alternate universe.

Obviously, once I [[Pixel Art Methods|found a way to make decent art]], I couldn't resist making art of my favorite Pokemon, the grass cat [[Sprigatito]], and his precious cross-eyed face.
