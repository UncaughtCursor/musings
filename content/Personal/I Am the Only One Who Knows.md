It seems as if I am the only one who truly knows of my possibly impending death. [[The Disease|My symptoms]] have progressed to the point of breathing dysfunction, and most other symptoms I have are connected to the brainstem according to sources online.

Sure, there's always a chance it won't happen, but there's really only so many things that can go wrong until a critical failure occurs. This disease is not stopping. It has a predilection for the brainstem. It has only been 2.5 years and I've already lost so much function.

I suspected immune-mediated destruction of the central nervous system 2 years ago. I predicted that it would damage my optic nerve, affect vital bodily functions, and eventually progress to the point of breathing disruption. In the past, these were all dismissed by overly pessimistic or anxious thoughts, even by myself. But they all came true.

I think people reject the idea because they don't want to accept it. They don't think something like this should happen. Maybe they don't want to lose me, or maybe the imagery of a young 21-year old male with no visible symptoms being terminally ill is absurd to them. But the disease doesn't care if other people can see the symptoms or not; it will continue regardless. Once people realize what is happening to me, it may already be too late.

I experience an eerily resolute acceptance of this. I would think I would be in constant terror of my life coming to an end, but I have simply accepted it now. Perhaps anxiety is of no use to me now. It will not change my fate.

I believe that by the time doctors confirm this is terminal, it will be too late to prepare for my death. That is why I am [[Publishing Life After Death|extensively documenting my thoughts]] and [[Pixel Art Methods|making art]] now. I know people will want these things, and I am being handed the opportunity to prepare for my death on a silver platter. So, I will dedicate time to giving people a picture of who I was. After all, I tend to [[Hiding My True Self|hide the majority of my thoughts and feelings]], so if I don't do this, many of the things I feel and believe will quickly be lost to time.

I am effectively beholden to my intuition here. It is the only entity that has given me a unified theory of my neurological problems, has made several correct predictions, and is now telling me that this is my chance to create the things I want to leave behind. That every day is another roll of the dice, and the only one I can guarantee will exist is today.

And you know what? That's entirely correct. For everyone.

Inevitably, some people will suddenly die from accidents or unexpected health problems, and a lot of those people probably would have wanted to make more things for their family to remember them for, perhaps writing, art, and pictures that capture the joy of the life they lived. People get so wrapped up in the careers and other aspects of their life that they sometimes forget to record these things. Not just the big moments, but also the small, day-to-day stuff, like personality, interests, and little things that they love.

No matter the outcome, even if I'm entirely wrong, it's good that I'm making something.
