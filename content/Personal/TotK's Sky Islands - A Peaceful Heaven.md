One of my favorite aspects of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the aesthetics of the sky islands. The golden foliage is so beautiful, accentuated by the constant sunlight. Sunsets are even prettier, with their glow making the foliage even more golden. It's a quiet, peaceful place, filled with nature and ambience. The music is composed of quiet woodwinds that ease in and out of the background and capture the serenity and peace.

Nothing ever changes. It's wonderfully relaxing all the time, for eternity. It's the perfect place to rest forever. This is heaven.
