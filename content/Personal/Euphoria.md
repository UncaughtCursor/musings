Euphoria, unbridled joy, is my favorite emotion on Earth. Whenever I feel it, I feel so grateful that I exist, that I'm alive, that I'm just able to experience it.

Whether it's from [[Loving Cuteness|adoring cute creatures]], showing compassion to friends, an emotional song, or just plain contentment, euphoria is always welcome and will always make me appreciate being alive, [[Hedonic Adaptation|even if my life isn't ideal]].

Euphoria is a strong factor in what makes life worth living.
