A flare-up of my condition can be triggered physically:

- When the neck is bent for an extended period of time
- When lifting heavy objects
- When high amounts of pressure are placed on the disc

The herniated disc's location is C7-T1, the base of the cervical spine.

Flare-ups cause weeks or months of pain and symptom progression. They often cause permanent damage. **They must be avoided at all costs.**

Physical flare-ups typically take effect 24 hours after the inciting event.

The tell-tale signs of a physical flare-up are:

- Dull pain in the C7-T1 location
- Many distinct instances of pain triggered by moving within seconds of each other
- Explosion of neurological pain and sensory symptoms the next day

## Physical Flare-Up Events

These events caused flare-ups of my disease:

| Apparent Cause                        | Date           | Effects                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Original herniation                   | 4/3/21         | After initial weakness, pain in hands                          |

| Bending neck to take exam for 2 hours | 11/10/21       | Pain spread to full body, bladder issues, optic neuritis, POTS |

## Non-Physical Flare-Up Events

These flare-ups were **not likely to be caused** by any physical event:

| Date     | Effects                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11/27/23 | Breathing that slows and stops, extreme myoclonus, and auditory hallucinations, all when trying to sleep, nasal myoclonus; NO increase in pain |

## Physical Non-Events

These events were expected to possibly cause a flare-up, but **did not**:

| Date | Event |
| ---- | ---- |
| 12/5/23 | Was sat up for several hours being out and about, shoulders hurt |
| 12/25/23 | Hugged by mom, arm wrapped around neck with force right above disc |
| 1/9/24 | Was sat up for a few hours being out and about, twice in one day, shoulders and neck hurt, mostly shoulders |
