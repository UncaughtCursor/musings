Because of [[the disease]], I believe that there's a good chance that I will pass away soon, even though [[I Am the Only One Who Knows|others are hesitant to believe it]]. However, there is a small chance that I will survive for longer than expected.

If I knew I was dying, I would want to spend my days a lot differently compared to if I knew I was going to survive for years. In the former case, I'd prefer to spend more time [[Publishing Life After Death|writing]], [[Pixel Art Methods|creating art]], and playing video games. In the latter, I would want to create and finish large projects like [[Project Maple]]. This creates a dilemma: I really want to enjoy my last days as much as I can. But, in case I'm wildly incorrect, I don't want to completely throw out my career.

I am now faced with the impossible task of predicting my own death despite my biases, incomplete knowledge, and the general uncertainty of life. My prediction will affect the choices I would make.

| Estimated Time Until Death | Confidence     | Lifestyle Choice                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Less than a year           | Any            | Happiness, creativity, and legacy |
| 1-5 years                  | Low            | Happiness, creativity, and legacy |
| 1-5 years                  | Medium or High | One more big project first        |
| More than 5 years          | Low            | Happiness, creativity, and legacy |
| More than 5 years          | Medium         | One more big project first        |
| More than 5 years          | High           | Pursue a career, move out         |

The majority of people under age 50 would have high confidence that they would live for at least another 5 years, making the pursuit of a career and independent living an obvious choice. But for me, this is called into question.

If I had to choose now, I would estimate that I have **1-5 years left with low confidence**, meaning I think there's a fair chance that it could also happen sooner.

This is effectively a question of whether or not to retire. Yes, it would seem as if my dream of retiring early might come true after all, even if it's in one of the most twisted ways possible. Perhaps when I thought of that wish, there was a [monkey's paw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey%27s_Paw) laying around nearby.
