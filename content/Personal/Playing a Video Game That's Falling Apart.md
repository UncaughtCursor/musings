Perhaps it could be said that life is a video game, where the human brain is both the player and the game. The brain defines the game, with its rewards (happiness, pleasure) and its penalties (pain, suffering) defining the landscape of play. The universe doesn't care about us, so it's the brain's job to define what we should feel.

Perhaps, then, the brainstem is the controller, a universal port that conveys our actions to the rest of the nervous system, which distributes these input signals into the relevant muscles.

My game is falling apart. More and more functions are glitching out, and it's clear that there's a hardware defect that is spreading and corrupting more of the code and frying more of the hardware. But there is no replacement or repair method, and you can't just reset the game. This brain is the mediator of my one and only subjective experience of reality. I must pick the controller back up and keep playing, even if my experience of reality itself shifts and distorts in indescribable ways.

And so, that's exactly what I will do.
