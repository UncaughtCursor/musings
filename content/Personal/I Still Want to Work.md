It turns out, just chilling for the last few months of my life can get kind of boring when I spent half of my life loving programming. It's a huge part of my life. As of writing this (1/26/24), I haven't really been programming for almost 3 months now.

But I can feel my passion for programming building in the background, beckoning me to make something cool again. Maybe that could be something like [[Project Zinc]] or something more important, like finishing [[Project Maple]].

If my [[The Disease|disease]] still doesn't prove to be immediately deadly, then, with respect to the future, my point of maximum vitality is now. Physical and cognitive disability are looming threats, so the time to live is now.

All of this has important implications for [[The Lifestyle Dilemma]], and is an important part of deciding on [[The Lifestyle Solution]].
