Welcome! This is a place for [[Publishing Life After Death|documenting my thoughts]] to give everyone a picture of what my life was like and who I truly was. It's basically a blog, but more dramatic.

Historically, I've [[Hiding My True Self|kept things close to my chest]], but recently I realized that if [[The Disease|my disease]] takes my life soon, then everyone, including my family, would only really know the boring outer shell I presented instead of the rich inner world that I inhabit. Much of my emotional depth would be lost to time, so I intend to rectify that here.

Consider this page to be your guide for all of these thoughts that I've written down.

## Format

These webpages are a series of notes linked to each other. Clicking through different ones will allow you to travel to different aspects of my life. I used [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to assemble the site from the notes.

One of the best features of Quartz is the graph view, which will allow you to view all of my notes as one big interconnected network, allowing you to see at a high level how notes connect to one another. I highly recommend using it to help you browse. The icon in the upper right allows you to view the whole network at once!

## Disclaimers

Keep the following in mind:

- I'm not a perfect individual. I make mistakes and I'm wrong sometimes.
- I might discuss sensitive topics if I find them important.
- I may be a bit different than what you expected or hoped for me to be, but I would ask that you keep an open mind.

## Other Things To Know

- To anyone who only knows me in real life, my online username is [[UncaughtCursor]], so whenever that comes up, just know that it's me.
- I'd prefer to share this with many others, so it would make me happy if this was shared with anyone who cares, even people who barely know me.
- You might occasionally see something marked "TODO," which indicates something I planned to elaborate on or add detail to at some point.

## Places to Start

First of all, I want to make it known that I [[Swearing About Life's Beauty|deeply loved life]] and it was the most amazing thing I've ever experienced.

## Enjoy!

I'm doing all of this to give closure to anyone who cared about me and allow them to learn about who I truly was as a person. If I've passed at the time of reading and you're sad that you didn't get to know me better before, just remember that we can still connect though my writing. I wanted to give people that opportunity.
