Some might attribute my misfortune to divine intervention, a punishment from God, for some reason, be it my agnostic atheism or left-leaning views. Assuming that God exists for the sake of this argument, I don't believe that this is the case. Assuming I am deceased by the time someone reads this: Although I'm aware that holding an argument from beyond the grave is just as futile as holding one while living, I will state my position here anyway.

God would most likely want this death to be drawn out and painful. But this is not what I currently observe.

- **I processed most of my anxiety about death already.** My constant fear of my [[The Disease|disease]] worsening, which later proved to be justified, prepared me for the possibility that I would not survive it. Eventually, I grew to accept that outcome more.
- **Most of my pain has disappeared.** The neuropathic pain my disease presented with has all but completely subsided now. Additionally, my psychological pain is diminished because of the above point.
- **I have time to write about and process my own death.** A punishment would be to prevent this from happening altogether, given my introspective nature.
- **I still feel gratitude and joy thinking about the parts of life I enjoyed most.** I'm really happy to have been alive, and these feelings only add to it.
- **I am likely to die in my sleep, completely unaware.** This is what I believe to be the [[Sleep is a Death Filter|least painful cause of death.]]

These factors create a calm, introspective time period, relatively devoid of pain and dotted with moments of joy. And, if I pass away, it will be in the least painful way possible. That doesn't sound like a punishment; if anything, it sounds like something a forgiving god would do if I was destined to die young.
